	  comment: I overheard classmates talking about starting the project and thought I should as well. Basically read all of the project description and created this file. Gotta start somewhere.

	  comment: Started to draw out initial design on paper. Also looked up good ways to do the design in graphical software. Settled on the Gliffy software package. It is free for a limited time and pretty easy to use as well.

	  comment: Trying to do interative coding practice so this was my first iteration after initial design. Completed all of the predicate functions and also made a working encode. Thought about decode but decided that was a task for next week.

	  comment: Back to the drawing board on decode. I know that I want to reverse the list but it definitely has taken some mental thought on how to do it. Finally figured out the tail recursion portion of the decode method. Decode makes much more sense now.

	  comment: Coded out the decode method and the two theorems that were described in the project description. They do not completely pass just yet but I am confident with a little tinkering I can make them work.

		comment: Still not a huge fan of PSP loging system... If I was not personally always out of time I would definitely sit down and write a GUI to make writing these logs much easier.

		comment: Graphical design software Gliffy is tedious in its exporting of files. Had to crop images just to export to word.

		comment: I assumed I would be able to clean the input up prior to running my functions. This assumption is not true and I must write helper functions to accomplish what is essentially input structuring.

		comment: Silly me forgot to have the mod m within the decode function. Found this after decode broke on several check expects.

		comment: Even after a final pass I was not able to get the theorems to successfully prove in proof pad. The overall logic is correct but I am sure I am missing a precondition or an edge case somewhere.
