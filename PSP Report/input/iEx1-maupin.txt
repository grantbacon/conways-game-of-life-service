	  comment: Realized today during class that waiting until the week the project was due would be a very bad idea. Unfortunately all I managed to accomplish today was setup the PSP files for this project. I will try to be more thorough with my logs this time around.

	  comment: I already began to break the promises I set out last week with. I came up with what I am confident is a decent design and have even begun the first steps of laying it out. I am confident that I can finish this quickly.

	  comment: Ran into trouble trying to program my design. Realized now why the assignment had a specific place for a redesign. All of my functions need helper functions it seems.

	  comment: Began writing test. Both property tests and check-expect tests. Realized very quickly that I would need to spend some time to make all of these tests pass.

	  comment: After looking through how I build lists recursively that I am making silly mistakes. Changed up a few appends to cons and also added a few if checks to make sure edge cases are handled appropriately. All tests now pass!

		type: Conceptual
		fix time: 1
		comment: I completely forgot how to use PSP and had to consult the online lecture notes.

		comment: Most functions still don't behave how I expect.
	- date: September 9, 2013
		type: Conceptual
		fix time: 1
		comment: I assumed I would be able to clean the input up prior to running my functions. This assumption is not true and I must write helper functions to accomplish what is essentially input structuring.

		comment: I thought the last run would be skipped entirely. A re-read of the project shows that is not the case. Thank you Dr Page for the FAQ you posted.

		comment: Most tests I wrote do not pass. Some I know where I am missing an edge case, some I hope creativity will help me.
