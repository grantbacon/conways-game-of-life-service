	  comment: file reading for both encode and decode was reading end-of-stream as a character in the file, which made both the encoding and decoding wrong

	  comment: encode-decode-str-round-trip property was taking a long time (several minutes without stopping, possibly infinite time) to admit to ACL2

	  comment: encode-decode-str-round-trip property was failing to admit to ACL2; fixed by adding additional theorems to help with intermediate steps

	  comment: (check-expect (chr->cod \Newline) 0) corner case check was failing because chr->cod was returning 32 for nonprintable characters instead of 0
