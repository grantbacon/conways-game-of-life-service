	  comment: ProofPad destroyed my work...it's now a corrupt 109 MB file. := As I have later discovered, this was caused by my own fault by "Building" my work to an executable, which obviously I shouldn't have done.

	  comment: Not able to create a random list of random integers and execute my functions properly.

	  comment: Took 2 hours to figure out the logic for finding the list of slopes, the difficult part was getting it to pick up both positive and negative runs. Picking up the last run without any peaks at the end of the list was fairly easy.
