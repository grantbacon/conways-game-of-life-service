	  comment: Got the encode-file function to finally work in both Windows and mac. Decode is still giving periodic troubles. Wrote all check expects and the defproperties. I don't know why on earth random-char wont work on ProofPad.

	  comment: Looked over everything again and realized I never revised my design. Decided that since I didn't change anything, there was no revision needed. Packaged everything and realized I still can't guarentee that the decode will actually work... Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't.

		comment: Didn't think about the encode function needing to have a sufficiently high value. 95 just was not cutting it as a encode and decode 'm' value.

		comment: File IO didn't seem to be working on the Mac OS. It would work under windows so I tried uninstalling ACL2 and Dr. Racket and that seemed to allow me to open and write to files in both Mac and Windows.

		comment: Dr. Racket is perfectly happy working with random-char and random-string but ProofPad does not like those functions. I don't know a better way to generate random data...
