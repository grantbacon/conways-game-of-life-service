	  comment: Took the time to sit down and think about the assignment. This felt largely useless for such a simple assignment however it is necessary to always have some form of design.

	  comment: Initial bout of code writing. Finished Problem 1 and managed to outline 3 and 4 as well.

	  comment: Came up with answers to 2 and 3 that are valid for large numbers of test cases but does not pass the theorem checking features of Proofpad. I think I am happier with the current status of my assignment.

defect log:
	- date: August 26, 2013
		type: Conceptual
		fix time: 1
		comment: The property for take and append is going incredibly slow and I have made the decision to finish other questions before diving back into it. 
	- date: August 26, 2013
		type: Conceptual
		fix time: 1
		comment: Along the same lines, my progress on the property test of append and nthcdr is crawling to the point of needing a break. 
	- date: August 27, 2013
		type: Spelling
		fix time: 1
		comment: I manage to consistently use equals instead of equal. This happened enough times that I found it appropriate to make a defect out of it.
