	  comment: created predicates, wrote and improved encode, became deeply confused about inverse modulo operations...

	  comment: thought defpred was a function, it was not. attempted to find ACL definition for a predicate, decided to simply use defun.

      comment: Defined encode, its "ABORTING..." but no  good reason why. I imagine recursion is not working properly, but I feel like the data set is being reduced properly...

      comment: Read Dr Page's suggestions online, then realized I was using len to check for lists... converted it to (consp (cdr xs)) because consp is a rather cheap function also made it easier for me to reason mentally about the reduction of lists over recursion

      comment: Realized the constraint of x_i < m make the function one-to-one, thus eliminating the possibility of modular overflow (where multiple values can represent the same thing). In fact, x + y <= 2m - 2 according to my shabby mathematics

      comment: Was reading the assignment definition wrong. Thought x_(n+1) = m - 1 regardless, and that decode was not fed m, but was to be given m explicitly...
